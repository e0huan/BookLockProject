BookLock
............................................................

Our team: Catherine Zheng, Elaine Huang

Description:

BookLock is a powerful tool for the smooth organization and management of spaces such as lockers, parking spaces, and desks. For each created room, the administrator can access, manage and view the booked and open spaces. Employees, customers, or students can book the available spaces. During the development of BookLock, the team will keep in mind user-friendly site navigation, steps taken in making remote reservations, and reporting to the administrators of each room to assist organizers in making informed and intelligent decisions. 

Undertaking this ambitious project is the BookLock team, which consists of Elaine Huang, the designer, and Catherine Zheng, the project manager. The designer develops the overall layout of the website according to the goals and requirements of the project. When any issues come up, the designer communicates them to the project manager, who helps find the best solution. The project manager is mainly responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the completion of specific tasks. Some duties include monitoring the team's progress, ensuring that group members complete tasks on time and that the project is still within scope. 

Concerning the project expectations, sections 4.0, 7.0, and 8.0 of this plan discuss criteria B1.1. Any tasks, deliverables, and the overall schedule have been determined with detail to maximize team efforts and productivity. The information applicable to B1.4 is in section 8.0, where project management tools will guide team members in remaining on task during the creation of the BookLock. The team will fulfill criteria B1.2 and B1.3 by regularly consulting the rubrics and this extensive project plan. The BookLock team will strive to accomplish all its objectives according to the project plan. An estimation of the project's duration is a month and a half.

How it Works:

BookLock rooms are all customizable, allowing the user to simulate an actual room when building a map on our website. All the while, BookLock shows the real-time space availability of spaces. That allows the users to have a layout of the room and book ahead of time. Not only is it more convenient to find the reserved space in reality, but also more organized. Lastly, it can also increase social distancing between people in times as such.  Profiles are also created allowing you to see multiple rooms, locker numbers booked, and locker combinations making it easier to remember and more user friendly.

Our website consists of ten pages: the homepage, the signup page, the login page, the instructions page, the profile page, the ‘Your Rooms’ (user’s rooms) page, and the ‘New Room’ page—also called the ‘Enter a Room Code/Create a New Room’ page—which then leads to either the questions page and administrator version map page or the booking version map page. The ‘Your Rooms page,’ profile page, ‘New Room’ page, and homepage are accessible from the menu/sidebar present on every single page except for the login page, the signup page, and the homepage. 

Our Goal:

BookLock intends to support any employees, employers, business owners, students, and teachers of any organization who need to manage spaces such as lockers or parking spaces more efficiently and online. The team is developing this website so that employers, teachers, or rather administrators can create and track the open and booked spaces of people online in any place. Students or employers, on the other hand, can book or view assigned places ahead of time. Generally, it could also benefit anybody else who wants to organize their space.

The top priority of BookLock is creating an unforgettable journey towards quality improvement and optimizing productivity for all users. All the while, BookLock focuses on customer satisfaction and allows users to remotely book spaces from the comfort of their own homes. The website simplifies the booking process by illustrating the map of a targeted area, showing real-time space availability, and retaining the location of the user’s reserved space and lock combination if applicable. Among many other user-friendly features, BookLock ensures that users can easily navigate through their experience. 

While supporting organizations in the COVID-19 transition, Booklock will help limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Beyond the coronavirus era, Booklock aspires to open a new realm of possibilities for building environments equipped for the future.

Do not touch the 'lib' folder or the 'php' file. These provide the custom PHP runtime.

The SQL folder contains sample SQL which you need to run on your MySQL server.

The htdocs folder contains all the PHP code and the images for the menu button and profile picture.
